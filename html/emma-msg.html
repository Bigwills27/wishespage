        "Dear Emmanuel,

        I don’t think I could ever put into words just how grateful I am for you. You’ve been more than just a friend,
        you’ve
        been a constant light and source of kindness in my life. Through every high and every low, you’ve stood by me
        and I feel
        so lucky to have someone as incredible as you by my side.

        Watching you shine academically and in everything you set your mind to has been such an inspiration. You give so
        much to
        others and I’m endlessly proud of all that you’re achieving. But please remember, even the brightest stars need
        rest,
        and it’s okay to lean on me, too. I’m here for you, just like you’ve always been for me. Don’t ever feel like
        you have
        to carry everything alone. I want to be there for you, just as you’ve been for me.

        So please, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re already doing so much more than you realize, and you’re making
        a
        difference in ways you might never know.

        Thank you for being you, Emmanuel. I’m endlessly grateful for you, and I’m here for you, always."
